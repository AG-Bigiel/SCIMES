Step-by-step description of the algorithm
=========================================
This guide provides an intuitive description of the steps followed 
by ``SCIMES`` to identify structure within a datasets. For this
example we use the position-position-velocity data cube of
the Orion-Monoceros complex imaged in 12CO(1-0) by 
`Wilson et al. 2005, A&A, 430, 523W <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...430..523W>`.
